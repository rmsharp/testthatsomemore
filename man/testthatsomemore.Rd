  - Tests involving the file system
}
\details{
For example, when files need to be present for a function we are testing,
it would be very cumbersome to create these files manually. Instead
testthatsomemore offers helper functions to create a structured set of
files:

\code{test_dir <- create_test_files(list(dir1 = list('file1',
   file2.r = 'print("Sample R code")'), file3.csv = "a,b,c\n1,2,3"))}

with the return value being a test directory containing these structured files.
Additionally, \code{create_test_files} has created an \code{on.exit} trigger
in the calling environment that will unlink everything in this test directory.
