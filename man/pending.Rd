\title{Display a yellow dot to indicate this test is pending implementation.}
\usage{
pending()
}
\description{
Note that the yellow dot allows easy use with the \code{"summary"}
reporter in the testthat package (see \code{testthat:::find_reporter}).
Using this function in a test also makes it explicitly clear that it
should be implemented shortly.
